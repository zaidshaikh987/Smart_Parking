---

## 🚀 To Switch from Demo to REAL

### 1. Install Real Vision Dependencies

```powershell
cd vision
pip install -r requirements_real.txt
```

This installs:
- OpenCV (video processing)
- YOLOv8 (vehicle detection)
- PyTorch (deep learning)

**Size:** ~2GB download

---

### 2. Get Video Footage

#### Option A: Use Existing Videos
```powershell
# Create videos folder
mkdir vision\videos

# Add your parking lot videos
# vision/videos/parking_lot_1.mp4
# vision/videos/parking_lot_2.mp4
```

#### Option B: Download Free Videos

**From Pexels (No login required):**
1. Go to https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/parking%20lot/
2. Download 1080p MP4 videos
3. Save to `vision/videos/`

**Recommended searches:**
- "parking lot surveillance"
- "parking lot camera"
- "parking lot timelapse"

#### Option C: Use Webcam
```yaml
# In vision/config/vision_config.yaml
source: 0  # Your webcam
```

---

### 3. Define Parking Slots

#### Quick Way (Use existing):
```yaml
# vision/config/vision_config.yaml already has slots defined
# Just update video path
```

#### Manual Way (Mark your own):
1. Pause your video at a clear frame
2. Take screenshot
3. Open in Paint
4. Note x,y coordinates of 4 corners per slot
5. Update `vision_config.yaml`

---

### 4. Run Real Vision Service

```powershell
# Stop the simulator (close that window)

# Run real service
cd vision\src
python real_vision_service.py
```

You'll see:
```
🎥 REAL VISION SERVICE WITH YOLOv8
📹 Processing real video footage
🤖 Using YOLOv8 for vehicle detection
✅ Camera CAM_01 initialized
✅ Real Vision Service Started
```

---

### 5. View Live Detection

Open browser:
```
http://localhost:8001/camera/CAM_01/frame
```

You'll see:
- 🎥 Actual video playing
- 🟢 Green boxes on FREE slots
- 🔴 Red boxes on OCCUPIED slots
- 🔵 Blue boxes around detected cars
- 📊 Confidence scores

---

## 🎬 Update Live Demo for Real Video

### Edit `LiveDemo.js`:

```javascript
// Replace simulated camera with real feed
<Box
  component="img"
  src="http://localhost:8001/camera/CAM_01/frame"
  sx={{
    width: '100%',
    height: 300,
    objectFit: 'cover'
  }}
/>
```

Now the Live Demo shows **REAL VIDEO** with **REAL DETECTION**!

## 🔌 What Still Needs Hardware

### 1. RFID Readers (ESP32)
**Currently:** Simulated
**To Make Real:**
- Buy ESP32 boards ($10 each)
- Buy MFRC522 RFID readers ($5 each)
- Upload firmware from `esp32/` folder
- Connect to WiFi and MQTT

### 2. License Plate Recognition
**Currently:** Simulated  
**To Make Real:**
- Use EasyOCR or Tesseract
- Add preprocessing (grayscale, threshold)
- Extract plate region with OpenCV
- Run OCR on extracted region

**Code example:**
```python
import easyocr
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])
result = reader.readtext(plate_image)
```

### 3. Physical Gates
**Currently:** Simulated relays
**To Make Real:**
- Use ESP32 with relay module
- Connect to barrier motors
- Control via MQTT commands
