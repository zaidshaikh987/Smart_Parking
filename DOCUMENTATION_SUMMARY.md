## 🚀 How to Apply the Cleanup

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
Run the cleanup script:
```powershell
.\cleanup_docs.bat
```

This will:
- Move old docs to `Docs/Archive/`
- Rename new consolidated docs
- Organize structure automatically

### Option 2: Manual
1. Read README.md
2. Follow SETUP.md for installation
3. Use QUICK_START_ESP32.md for ESP32-CAM
4. Refer to detailed guides as needed

## 🎯 Quick Navigation

**I want to...**

| Task | Document to Read |
|------|-----------------|
| Understand what this project does | README.md |
| Set up the entire system | SETUP.md |
| Connect ESP32-CAM quickly | QUICK_START_ESP32.md |
| Detailed ESP32-CAM setup | esp32_firmware/ESP32_SETUP_GUIDE.md |

## ✨ Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clarity** - Know exactly which file to read
2. **Simplicity** - Only 6 files instead of 23
3. **Organization** - Logical hierarchy
4. **No Duplicates** - Single source of truth
5. **Easy Updates** - Maintain fewer files
6. **Onboarding** - New users find info faster

## 💡 Documentation Best Practices Going Forward

1. **One Topic, One File** - Don't mix unrelated topics
2. **Clear Naming** - Filename should describe content
3. **Update Existing** - Don't create new files for updates
4. **Link, Don't Duplicate** - Reference other docs instead of copying content
5. **Keep Root Clean** - Only essential docs in root directory

## 📝 Summary

- **Before:** 23+ scattered documentation files
- **After:** 6 organized essential files
- **Action:** Run `cleanup_docs.bat` to apply
- **Result:** Clean, professional, easy-to-navigate documentation
